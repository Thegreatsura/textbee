 * `{ plan, isActive, usage }` with no status, no amount and no dates.
 *
 * The billing page used to read that second shape as a subscription with
 * missing fields, so every free user was told their status was "Unknown" and
 * shown two "N/A" billing dates. Absence of a status is not an unknown status:
 * it means there is nothing to have a status.
 *
 * A paid plan name arriving without a status is still genuinely unknown, and
 * is reported that way rather than being flattened into Free.
